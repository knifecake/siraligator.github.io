A trombone looks like a crocodile. Besides that, the first people who sang blues were called alligators... The Sir Alligator’s Company is a low brass ensemble that approaches rock, pop and soul music from a classical perspective. Trombones and tubas completely change their traditional role as “classical instruments” when they are adapted to the songs of Michael Jackson, Tom Jones, Henri Mancini, Nino Bravo, Fredie Mercury, Joe Cocker, Elton John, Nino Rota, Frank Sinatra, James Brown, Ennio Morricone, The Mamas & The Papas, Lester Bowie, etc…This music undergoes an interesting transformation... Since 1995, the group has experimented with new ways of reaching other people who had never heard trombones and tubas played before. They have performed for different kinds of audiences: the Contemporary Music Festival of Alicante in 1998, “La 2” TV Channel Concerts (Spanish Radio & Television, RTVE), 2001 Charity Gala of FAD (Foundation for the Treatment of Drug Addiction), which was broadcast by RTVE, 2001 UER Congress in Madrid, VI Jazz Festival of Ezcaray, Valencia Tour, Galicia Tour, Castilla-La Mancha Tour, Castilla-León Tour, the País Vasco Tour and Madrid Tour, television programs; and have played in numerous Spanish Conservatories, in International Music Courses, like the Riva de Garda one in Italy, in jazz clubs, concerts for children…and the group has always come to the same conclusion: the music they play on their trombones and tubas is greatly enjoyed by a wide audience. They were chosen Best New Group by Radio3 (Spanish National Radio, RNE) for their 1999 Live CD. Later, in 2005, they released their second album called “Algo hay”, and also a third album, “Acarrassats Friends Projet”, recorded live in collaboration with a group of musicians in the Galileo Club in Madrid. In addition to rock, pop and soul, they have performed in other kinds of shows, like the “Tuve Tuba por un Tubo” opera composed by Fernando Palacios, and “Light Metal”, a journey through the history of brass instruments in the last seven hundred years.
